# ask-me-anything
A place where you can ask me anything about frontend, architecture, performance or general career stuff. 
I will also use this to add commonly asked questions to me (from other social media) and answer it here. 

Use discussion tab to ask any question or look through already answered questions.

If you are not comfortable to ask in public, you can choose to DM in twitter (https://twitter.com/_syadav). If I feel the question might benefit others I will myself add the question here and share you the link.
